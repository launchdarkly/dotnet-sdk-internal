    /// The reason we define these as types, rather than just having those methods take a bunch
    /// of individual parameters like timestamp and key, is to make it as easy as possible to add
    /// new optional properties: adding a parameter to a method is a backward-incompatible change
    /// (unless we add overloads, in which case we'll keep accumulating overloads) whereas adding
    /// a property to a struct means it'll just have its default value if the caller doesn't set
    /// it. We could get a similar effect by using named method parameters with defaults, but
    /// that only ensures compile-time compatibility - at runtime the method still has a
    /// different signature - so this way is a bit cleaner.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Note that these are declared as structs rather than classes so that, at least when
    /// they're originally created, they can live on the stack instead of the heap. They will
    /// still eventually end up getting treated as class instances and moved to the heap, because
    /// of .NET's boxing rules: whenever a struct is treated as a dynamically-typed object (i.e.
    /// when we wrap it in an EventMessage to put it on our queue), it is boxed. But until that
    /// point, application code can freely create these and pass them around without incurring
    /// any allocations, right up until the moment when EventProcessor decides to put the event
    /// onto a queue (if it does). This is also why there's a separate EventProcessor method
    /// for each type, rather than having a single RecordEvent that takes a base type: using
    /// polymorphism in that way would cause boxing to always happen.
